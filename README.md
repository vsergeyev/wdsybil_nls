# WDSybil NLS files
===================

WDSybil NLS files - English, German, Russian.

Russian files should be in CP866 codepage.

Have found these localization files on my old PC while trying to fix it with my dauther.
Issue was in old AC power unit, so HDD is ok. Some files from my old life in
OS/2 Warp development.

WDSybil (https://www.wdsibyl.org/) is Pascal compiler and IDE which works a very "Delphi"-like.
There are Compiler for OS/2 and IDE with text editor, forms designer and debugger.
